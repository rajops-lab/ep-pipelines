# Harry's Jenkins Pipeline Mastery

## The 20% You Need to Know

### Core Concepts (5 minutes reading):
1. **Shared Library** = Reusable pipeline functions in `vars/`
2. **Job Configuration** = Individual app deployments in `ci/`
3. **App Templates** = Kubernetes YAML templates in `app-config/`
4. **Environment Config** = Environment-specific variables in `env-config/`

### The Magic Formula:
```
Library Function + Job Config + App Template + Env Config = Working Pipeline
```

## Learning Path:
1. Create your first shared library function
2. Write a simple app deployment
3. Make it configurable for different environments
4. Scale to multiple apps
5. Add monitoring and notifications
